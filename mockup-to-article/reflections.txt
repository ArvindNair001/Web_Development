Your response goes here!

I've learned to carefully observe web-page.

Since the links were already provided it was easy to create an image and link tag.

The most difficult part was stylizing the code with proper indentations it was time consuming compared to Programming languages which normally
don't require to print a large block of code.but I had fun ;).


First off, this course allowed me to observe each every details of the webpage carefully, I noticed that the website was wrapped in figure tag
before this course I've never paid so much attention to the structure of any sites. But now I look at even the smallest things that normal people
ignore , even though I've a lot of experience programing with C and Java.
I hope that web development becomes my second nature just like the others I'm used to.

Thank You !!
